sudo add-apt-repository universe
sudo apt install libfuse2t64
Donwload Davinci Resolve and extract it the open terminal from your file manager in the location of davinci resolve and run this command
SKIP_PACKAGE_CHECK=1 ./DaVinci_Resolve_20.2.2_Linux.run

go to folder /opt/resolve/libs and delete so type this command under in terminal
cd /opt/resolve/libs

Run these 3 commands in terminal

sudo rm libglib-2.0.so*
sudo rm libgio-2.0.so*
sudo rm libgmodule-2.0.so*


If you have Amd gpu note Davinci won't detect your gpu unless you Install Rocm so here is how to install it:

Rocm:

sudo mkdir --parents --mode=0755 /etc/apt/keyrings

wget https://repo.radeon.com/rocm/rocm.gpg.key -O - | \
    gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/rocm.gpg > /dev/null 

Run this one as one command so copy all of it:

sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rocm.list << EOF
deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/rocm.gpg] https://repo.radeon.com/rocm/apt/7.0.2 noble main
deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/rocm.gpg] https://repo.radeon.com/graphics/7.0.2/ubuntu noble main
EOF
sudo tee /etc/apt/preferences.d/rocm-pin-600 << EOF
Package: *
Pin: release o=repo.radeon.com
Pin-Priority: 600
EOF


sudo apt update

you could install the full Rock package but it would take up to 24gb of space so for Davinci the runtime is enough

sudo apt install rocm-opencl-runtime

where it says your name just remove and put your user name

sudo usermod -a -G video,render yourname
